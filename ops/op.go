// An Op is a symbolic representation of an operation
// Think of them as functions, taking an input (or multiple), and outputting something
//
// All Ops have type signatures that look like this:
//		OpName :: (Floats a) ⇒ Tensor a → Tensor a → Tensor a
//
// All Ops need to know somethings about themselves - there is no support for generic Ops.

	// Arity returns the number of inputs the Op expects. -1 indicates that it's n-ary and will be determined at runtime.
	Arity() int

	// Type informs the type of the Op (not the node). This will be used by the type system to infer the final type of the node.

	// Task generates a trace.Task for the Op. The Op is responsible for naming the task.
	//
	// In general it is best to just name it in the most general way possible.
	//
	// e.g. if a op is a reshape operation, then the standard implementation would have the
	// target shape as part of the name (e.g. "reshape(2,3)"). In this case it's best to just
	// call the task name "reshape", instead of "reshape(2,3)"

	// OverwritesInput() is a method which states which input the output will be overwriting.
	// This allows for some efficiency gains as the underlying arrays wouldn't have to be re-allocated.
	// The method returns an int instead of a bool because potentially different operations may be allowed
	// to overwrite certain inputs. For example, consider an operation to increment a value:
	// the IncrementOp would be a unary operator, and assuming we would like to overwrite the input,
	// the retVal of overwriteInput() will be 0 (inputs[0]).
	// -1 is returned if overwriting of input is disallowed
